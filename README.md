# 🏥 Healthcare EDA Project

This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a healthcare dataset.  
The analysis focuses on understanding patient demographics, hospital stay patterns, billing insights, and key statistical relationships.  
The project was originally executed in Jupyter Notebook and exported as an HTML report.

## 📌 Project Overview

The main goals of this EDA were:

- To understand the structure and quality of the healthcare dataset  
- To perform data cleaning & preprocessing  
- To explore patient characteristics and treatment patterns  
- To identify correlations between variables  
- To visualize important health-related insights  
- To detect anomalies, trends, and patterns in patient billing and stay duration

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

### ✔ **1. Data Cleaning**
- Handling missing values  
- Removing duplicates  
- Correcting inconsistent data  
- Data type conversions  

### ✔ **2. Descriptive Statistics**
Includes:
- Patient age distribution  
- Gender breakdown  
- Admission types  
- Stay duration statistics  
- Billing amount statistics  

### ✔ **3. Correlation Analysis**
Example:
- Relationship between **Stay_Days** and **Billing Amount**  
- Relationship between demographic factors and cost  
- Identifying which variables have strongest influence  

### ✔ **4. Visualization EDA**
Multiple charts were created such as:

- Histograms  
- Bar charts  
- Box plots  
- Count plots  
- Heatmap (correlation)  
- Distribution of billing amounts  
- Stay duration segmentation  

These help reveal:
- Outliers  
- Skewness  
- Trends  
- Patient volume by category

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** (data cleaning & manipulation)
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🧪 Key Insights

Some example insights derived from the analysis:

- Certain admission types are more common than others.  
- Billing Amount does **not strongly correlate** with Stay_Days.  
- Distribution of patient age and stay length reveals patterns in hospital utilization.  
- Visualizations highlight skewness in billing & stay durations.
